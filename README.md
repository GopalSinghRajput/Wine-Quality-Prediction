# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Wine Quality Prediction using different machine learning algorithms

# Dataset
The dataset for thsi project is used from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)

# Project Overview
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
Explored the relationships between the features and the target variable (wine quality).
* Model Development
### Implemented various classification models to predict the wine quality:
Linear Regression: Achieved Mean Squared Errorof 0.0925

Random Forest Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 86%.

SGD Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 82%.

Support Vector Classifier (SVC): Achieved an accuracy of 86%.

GridSearchCV: Improved the SVC accuracy to 90% and Random Forest accuracy to 91%.

# Model Evaluation
Assessed the performance of the models using accuracy scores.
Utilized techniques such as GridSearchCV to optimize the hyperparameters of the models.
